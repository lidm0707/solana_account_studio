- 🎯 **Cross-platform data consistency**

### **User Experience Metrics**
- 🎯 **Desktop app**: Professional native experience
- 🎯 **Web app**: Browser-based access with full functionality
- 🎯 **Terminal app**: Power user CLI/TUI interface
- 🎯 **Account management**: Create, import, view accounts
- 🎯 **Transaction capabilities**: Build, sign, send transactions

## 🛠️ BREAKTOOL FAST-MVP METHODOLOGY

### **Speed-First Approach**
1. **Bulk Fix Strategy**: Fix all errors of one type at once
2. **Platform Priority**: Desktop → Web → Terminal
3. **Core Features First**: Accounts → Transactions → Balance → Networks
4. **Continuous Integration**: Auto-push every 30 minutes
5. **MVP Scope Control**: Essential features only, postpone advanced features

### **Error Resolution Patterns**
```rust
// Pattern 1: RSX Syntax Fixes
class="value" → class: "value"

// Pattern 2: API Updates
old_method() → new_method()

// Pattern 3: Dependency Resolution
Add missing crate to Cargo.toml
```

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

### **This Session (Next 2 Hours)**
1. **✅ COMPLETED: Platform Foundation** (All platforms build)
2. **🔄 CURRENT: Account Management** (60 min)
3. **Transaction Builder Implementation** (45 min)
4. **Push Progress** (auto every milestone)

### **Success Criteria**
- ✅ All 3 platforms build and run
- ✅ Basic Solana account management working
- ✅ Transaction creation and signing functional
- ✅ Git push loop delivering continuous progress

## 🎊 MVP VISION

**SurfDesk MVP** will be a **fully functional Solana account studio** that runs on desktop, web, and terminal platforms. Users will be able to:

- Manage Solana accounts across all platforms
- Build and send transactions with confidence
- Monitor balances and network activity

🧠 Agent Logic (Summary)

The Agent will:

Load this checklist

Execute tasks sequentially (skip done ✅)

After each successful task:

Run:

git add .
git commit -m "feat: ✅ [Task Name] - $(date)"
git push origin main


Log progress to file: mvp-progress.log

Continue until all items are marked ✅

🔁 Optional: Store Checklist Progress

Save checklist to a YAML or JSON file like:

phase1:
  - task: Fix RSX syntax errors
    done: false
  - task: Check missing props
    done: false
phase2:
  - task: Implement account create/import
    done: false


So the agent can re-run anytime and resume from the last unfinished step.

Would you like me to generate this checklist as a .yaml or .md file (for the agent to read automatically)?
If you confirm the format, I’ll make it executable with ./continuous-mvp-agent.sh so it can track, update, and auto-push after each ✅ completion.

**Execute: `./fast-mvp-dev.sh` every 30 minutes for continuous MVP delivery!**
