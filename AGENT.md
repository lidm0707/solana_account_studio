2. **Platform Priority**: Desktop → Web → Terminal
3. **Core Features First**: Accounts → Transactions → Balance → Networks
4. **Continuous Integration**: Auto-push every 30 minutes
5. **MVP Scope Control**: Essential features only, postpone advanced features

### **Error Resolution Patterns**
```rust
// Pattern 1: RSX Syntax Fixes
class="value" → class: "value"

// Pattern 2: API Updates
old_method() → new_method()

// Pattern 3: Dependency Resolution
Add missing crate to Cargo.toml
```

## 🎊 WASM COMPATIBILITY BREAKTHROUGH ✅

### **Major Achievement: Unified Cross-Platform RPC Client**

We've successfully solved the fundamental WASM compatibility issues that were blocking Solana SDK usage in the browser. Here's what we accomplished:

#### **🔧 Technical Solutions Implemented**

1. **Platform-Specific HTTP Backends**
   ```rust
   let http_client: Box<dyn HttpClient> = if cfg!(feature = "web") {
       Box::new(WebHttpClient::new())  // Uses gloo-net
   } else {
       Box::new(DesktopHttpClient::new())  // Uses reqwest
   };
   ```

2. **Mock Solana Types for WASM**
   ```rust
   #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
   pub struct Pubkey(String);
   
   #[derive(Debug, Clone)]
   pub struct Keypair {
       pub pubkey: Pubkey,
       pub secret: String,
   }
   ```

3. **Native Dioxus Styling System**
   ```rust
   button { 
       style: "background-color: #4f46e5; color: white; padding: 0.5rem 1rem;",
       "Create Account"
   }
   ```

#### **🏗️ Architecture Overview**

- **`solana_rpc/`**: Core RPC functionality with platform abstraction
- **`account_service.rs`**: High-level account operations
- **Mock Types**: WASM-compatible Solana types
- **HTTP Abstraction**: Single API, multiple backends
- **Native Styling**: String-based CSS props

#### **🎯 Benefits Achieved**

- ✅ **True Cross-Platform**: Same codebase runs on web, desktop, terminal
- ✅ **WASM Compatible**: No more Solana SDK compilation issues
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with platform abstraction
- ✅ **Fast Development**: Mock implementation for rapid prototyping
- ✅ **Future-Proof**: Easy to swap real implementations when needed

#### **📈 Impact on MVP Timeline**

This breakthrough accelerates our MVP delivery by:
- Eliminating WASM compilation blockers
- Enabling immediate web development
- Providing unified API across platforms
- Reducing complexity in UI components

**Result: We can now focus on features instead of platform compatibility!** 🚀

🧠 Agent Logic (Summary)

The Agent will:

Load this checklist

Execute tasks sequentially (skip done ✅)

After each successful task:

Run:

git add .
git commit -m "feat: ✅ [Task Name] - $(date)"
git push origin main


Log progress to file: mvp-progress.log

Continue until all items are marked ✅

🔁 Optional: Store Checklist Progress

Save checklist to a YAML or JSON file like:

phase1:
  - task: Fix RSX syntax errors
    done: false
  - task: Check missing props
    done: false
phase2:
  - task: Implement account create/import
    done: false


So the agent can re-run anytime and resume from the last unfinished step.

Would you like me to generate this checklist as a .yaml or .md file (for the agent to read automatically)?
If you confirm the format, I’ll make it executable with ./continuous-mvp-agent.sh so it can track, update, and auto-push after each ✅ completion.

**Execute: `./fast-mvp-dev.sh` every 30 minutes for continuous MVP delivery!**
