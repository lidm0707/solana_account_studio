## 📊 IMPORTANT LESSONS LEARNED - AGENT INSIGHTS

### **🔧 Technical Architecture Insights**
1. **WASM Compatibility is the Biggest Challenge**: Standard Solana SDK won't work in browsers. Solution: Mock types + platform-specific HTTP clients.
2. **Type System Unification is Critical**: Duplicate types across modules cause endless conflicts. Solution: Single source of truth in `solana_rpc`.
3. **Platform Abstraction Layers are Essential**: Different platforms need different backends. Solution: `cfg!` traits with platform-specific implementations.
4. **Mock Implementation Accelerates Development**: Real Solana dependencies slow down web development. Solution: Mock types for rapid prototyping.

### **📈 Development Strategy Insights**
1. **Error Bulk-Fix Strategy Works**: Fix all errors of one type at once rather than one-by-one.
2. **Continuous Git Push Maintains Momentum**: Regular progress commits keep team motivated and track progress.
3. **Architecture First Prevents Rework**: Solid foundation enables rapid feature implementation later.
4. **Cross-Platform Priority Matters**: Solve desktop first, then adapt for web and terminal.

### **🚀 Agent Success Factors**
1. **Clear Mission Definition**: Fastest path to MVP with specific success criteria.
2. **Systematic Error Tracking**: Reduce from 76+ to 0 errors with targeted fixes.
3. **Platform-Specific Solutions**: Different approaches for web vs desktop vs terminal.
4. **Incremental Delivery**: Each major milestone is committed and pushed immediately.

### **⚠️ Critical Dependencies to Monitor**
1. **Solana SDK Compatibility**: Watch for WASM-breaking changes in Solana SDK updates.
2. **Dioxus Framework Updates**: Web framework changes may affect RSX and styling.
3. **WASM Toolchain**: `wasm-pack`, `gloo-net`, `wasm-bindgen` compatibility issues.
4. **Cross-Platform Build**: Ensure all three platforms continue to build successfully.

### **🎯 Future Development Recommendations**
1. **Real Solana Integration**: Replace mock types with real Solana SDK when WASM support improves.
2. **Advanced Features**: Add SurfPool integration, advanced transaction types, DeFi protocols.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize web application loading and runtime performance.
4. **Security Enhancements**: Implement proper key management, encryption, and secure transaction signing.

### **📋 Documentation Requirements**
1. **API Documentation**: Comprehensive inline docs for all public functions and types.
2. **Architecture Documentation**: Clear explanation of cross-platform RPC client design.
3. **User Documentation**: Step-by-step guides for account creation, transactions, and network switching.
4. **Developer Documentation**: Setup instructions, build guides, and contribution guidelines.

🧠 Agent Logic (Summary)

The Agent will:

Load this checklist

Execute tasks sequentially (skip done ✅)

After each successful task:

Run:

git add .
git commit -m "feat: ✅ [Task Name] - $(date)"
git push origin main


Log progress to file: mvp-progress.log

Continue until all items are marked ✅

🔁 Optional: Store Checklist Progress

Save checklist to a YAML or JSON file like:

phase1:
  - task: Fix RSX syntax errors
    done: false
  - task: Check missing props
    done: false
phase2:
  - task: Implement account create/import
    done: false


So the agent can re-run anytime and resume from the last unfinished step.

Would you like me to generate this checklist as a .yaml or .md file (for the agent to read automatically)?
If you confirm the format, I’ll make it executable with ./continuous-mvp-agent.sh so it can track, update, and auto-push after each ✅ completion.

**Execute: `./fast-mvp-dev.sh` every 30 minutes for continuous MVP delivery!**
