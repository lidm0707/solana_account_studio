No use anchor or solana sdk. Just use my solana_rpc.
You must work in continuous development cycles until there are no errors or warnings left if warnning is don't use code you just impl real future and use it.
Each cycles must be to git push.
Dioxus can't use Arc.
Solana uses Base58.
dir/docs is main context.

context7 have mcp for get stack for this project.
can you try surfpool pass mcp on zed.
In each cycle:
1. Run `scripts/read_all_docs.sh to and read all project documentation, code comments, and logs. Collect all errors, warnings, and TODO notes. Summarize them and plan the best way to fix them then git push.
2. Fix all errors first. Then resolve warnings and improve code quality without introducing new issues.
3. Re-read all documentation, rethink project direction, and improve README.md, agent.md and ROADMAP.md based on new understanding. After improvements, commit and git push your changes.

Repeat the cycle until the project has no errors, no warnings, and documentation is fully updated.
